      <h1 id="goals">Why have goals?</h1>
      <p>Professionally, I'm working on my Product Design and Strategy craft. In the next 2 years I'd like to become a Product Design Manager. Before focusing on managing, I want to build more craft skills. I think that will make me a better manager. Personally, I'm working on a healthy balance and being outside more. Why have goals? If you don't know what your goals are you don't know what success looks like.</p>

      <h2>Professional goals</h2>
      <p>This list includes some professional goals.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Front-end web development. I'm not sure if I want to write production code, but I'd like to understand HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I'd like to be able to prototype in the browser should the situation call for it.</li>
        <li>Web accessibility. As long as I'm learning front-end, why wouldn't I learn how to make the sites I'm learning to build accessible at the same time?</li>
        <li>Public speaking. I love going to conferences and hearing from folks about their work. I want to contribute to that and also get the heck over my fears, you know?</li>
      </ol>
